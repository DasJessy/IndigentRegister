# IndigentRegister
A municipality project where the system kept a register of all the indigents in that area. Generating multiple
reports based on the indigents data, the reports include graphical reports, geological report using maps
and status reports in the form of a pdf. 

This system was built on a three-tier architecture having a business
layer, data layer, and application layer. The technologies used in the development of this system included
Asp.Net, MSSQL, JavaScript, HTML CSS, Itextsharp and the Google Maps API.
